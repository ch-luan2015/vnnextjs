[![Blog Post Views](/static/images/real-time-post-views/chart.png)](https://github.com/timqian/chart.xkcd)

One metric for a website's success is the amount of traffic it receives.
For a blog, this translates to page views. Articles with lots of views indicate the content your readers care most about.
This helps drive future articles.

Most people measure view counts via analytics (like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)).
However, with the rise of ad-blocking browser extensions, these counts are likely [~10% off](https://moz.com/blog/analytics-black-holes) (especially if your target market is tech).
What if we could have better accuracy, better performance, and better privacy for our users?

## Who Is This For?

Anyone running their own blog, whether that's using
vanilla React or a static-site generator like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/features/static-exporting).

## Technical Overview

### Objective

Display a real-time view count for a given blog post.
This should not block the page load and should log views asynchronously.
The client should automatically update when it receives a new count from the server.

### Server

To track views, we will be creating a serverless microservice with [Micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) and a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).
Given an ID query parameter (`/?id=$id`) our microservice should increment views for the corresponding post in Firebase.
It should also prevent abuse by logging IPs.

### Client

Our client application should [lazy-load](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/lazy-loading-components) the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js) on page load and subscribe to view counts.
When it receives a new count, the counter should highlight and update.

We can host and deploy this entire solution **for free** using Firebase's [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Amazing.

## Setting Up Firebase

1. If you do not have a Firebase account, create one first.
1. Create a new project.
1. Navigate to "Database" and click "Create Database".

1. Start in test mode and click next.
   ![Create Firebase Database](/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step2.png)
1. Choose your database location and click done.
   ![Create Firebase Database](/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step3.png)
1. In the top left, click on "Project Settings".
   ![Create Firebase Database](/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step4.png)
1. Navigate to "Service Accounts" tab and click "Generate new private key". Save the `.json` file. You will need this later.

We're finished! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully set up a realtime database, as well as generated credentials for your microservice to connect to the database.

## Creating The Microservice

> Update 2020: I've switched my microservice to an [API route](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/pages/api/increment-views.js) inside my Next.js application. If you're using Next.js, I would recommend this approach.

This blog post was inspired by Guillermo Rauch's [blog](https://github.com/rauchg/blog), where he open-sourced [his code](https://github.com/rauchg/blog-views). I've updated some things but this is largely inspired by his work ðŸŽ‰

You can view the entire source code [here](https://github.com/leerob/blog-views). I'll be explaining some key concepts for how the microservice works.

### Connecting To Firebase

Before we can log views, we need to connect to our Firebase Realtime Database.
Place your `service-account.json` in the root of the repo.
This file is inside `.gitignore` so it won't be committed to GitHub. We can connect to the database using [firebase-admin](). Make sure you update the `databaseURL`.

```js
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const { join } = require('path');
const cert = join(__dirname, '../service-account.json');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(cert),
  databaseURL: 'https://your-blog.firebaseio.com'
});

module.exports = admin.database();
```

### Tracking Views

To track a view, we need to look at the database for `views -> id`.

```js
const db = require('./db');

module.exports = function incrementViews(id) {
  const ref = db.ref('views').child(id);
  return ref.transaction((currentViews) => {
    // if it has never been set it returns null
    if (currentViews === null) currentViews = 0;
    return currentViews + 1;
  });
};
```

### Putting It All Together

The entry point into the application sets CORS headers, checks for a valid request, parses the `id` query parameter, and increments the value for the given `id`. Make sure to update the URL for your blog.

```js
const verify = require('./lib/verify');
const { parse } = require('url');
const increment = require('./lib/increment-views');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  const orig = req.headers.origin;
  if (/https:\/\/(.*\.)?leerob\.io/.test(orig)) {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', orig);
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET');
  }

  // ensure no duplicate views
  verify(req);
  const {
    query: { id }
  } = parse(req.url, true);

  if (!id) {
    const err = new Error('Missing `id` parameter');
    err.statusCode = 400;
    throw err;
  }

  const { snapshot } = await increment(id);
  return { total: snapshot.val() };
};
```

## Deploying and Testing View Counts

After you've [cloned the repo](https://github.com/leerob/blog-views) and followed the steps above to substitute your values, run `yarn dev` to start the microservice.

Using your favorite REST client or your browser, you can now hit `http://localhost:3000?id=blog-post` to log a view.

![Testing Microservice](/static/images/real-time-post-views/microservice.jpg)

We can confirm it was logged correctly by checking Firebase.

![Testing Firebase](/static/images/real-time-post-views/testing-database.png)

### Deployment with Vercel

We can configure our microservice to deploy with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) through a `vercel.json` file.
Update the `name` and `alias` to be unique for your microservice.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "your-blog-views",
  "alias": "your-blog-views",
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "now-micro" }]
}
```

After installing the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download), you can deploy in _one command_ ðŸš€

```bash
$ vc --prod
```

You should now be able to hit `https://your-blog-views.now.sh/`.

## Lazy-Loading Firebase Client Side

Firebase is a large module. In fact, it's larger than `react`, `react-dom` and `next` _combined_.
We only want to load the parts of Firebase we need (`firebase/app` and `firebase/database`) and we don't want to block the page load.

Let's lazy-load the Firebase JavaScript SDK.

```js
export default async function loadDb() {
  const firebase = await import('firebase/app');

  await import('firebase/database');

  try {
    firebase.initializeApp({
      databaseURL: 'https://your-blog.firebaseio.com'
    });
  } catch (error) {
    /*
     * We skip the "already exists" message which is
     * not an actual error when we're hot-reloading.
     */
    if (!/already exists/.test(error.message)) {
      console.error('Firebase initialization error', error.stack);
    }
  }

  return firebase.database().ref('views');
}
```

## Real-Time View Count Updates

Now that our microservice is deployed, we can instruct our client to asynchronously log a view when the page loads. We also need to subscribe to the view counts for the given blog post ID so the client updates every time the value changes.

Let's create a `<ViewCounter />` component.

**Note**: The `<Views />` component will be created next.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

import loadDb from '../lib/load-db';

import Views from './views';

function ViewCounter({ id }) {
  const [views, setViews] = useState('');

  // Subscribe to view count updates
  useEffect(() => {
    const onViews = (newViews) => setViews(newViews.val());
    let db;

    const fetchData = async () => {
      db = await loadDb();
      db.child(id).on('value', onViews);
    };

    fetchData();

    return function cleanup() {
      db.child(id).off('value', onViews);
    };
  }, [id]);

  // Asynchronously log a view
  useEffect(() => {
    const registerView = () =>
      fetch(`https://your-blog-views.now.sh/?id=${encodeURIComponent(id)}`);

    registerView();
  }, [id]);

  return <Views views={views} />;
}

export default ViewCounter;
```

Now, let's look at `<Views />`.
This component should accept a prop `views` and display a formatted string that highlights when the value updates.

- For styling, I'm using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
- For formatting, I'm using [comma-number](https://www.npmjs.com/package/comma-number).

First, let's look at the styles. A `highlight` prop controls a CSS animation.

```cs
const highlightBackgound = keyframes`
    from {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    to {
        background-color: #fff;
    }
`;

const StyledViews = styled.span`
    font-size: 0.9em;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    letter-spacing: 0.04em;

    ${(props) =>
        props.highlight &&
        css`
            animation-name: ${highlightBackgound};
            animation-duration: 1s;
        `}
`;
```

When a new `views` prop is passed to the component, it sets the highlight state to `true`.
After 2 seconds, it resets the highlight state.

```jsx
import format from 'comma-number';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import styled, { css, keyframes } from 'styled-components';

function Views(props) {
  const [highlight, setHighlight] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (props.views) {
      setHighlight(true);
    }

    setTimeout(() => {
      setHighlight(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, [props.views]);

  const formattedViews = `${format(props.views)} views`;

  return (
    <Container>
      <StyledViews highlight={highlight}>{` - ${
        props.views && formattedViews
      }`}</StyledViews>
    </Container>
  );
}

export default Views;
```

Finally, we can consume the view counter in our blog post and pass in the ID.

```jsx
<ViewCounter id="post-id" />
```

You can see a completed client-side example by checking out [this blog post's source code](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).

## Conclusion

It works! ðŸŽ‰

I was able to migrate my page views from Google Analytics into Firebase via their web interface.

**Note**: If your site receives a lot of traffic, you'll need to upgrade from the Spark plan (free) to Blaze (pay-as-you-go).
On Spark, you can only have 100 simultaneous connections. With Blaze, you can have 100k.
