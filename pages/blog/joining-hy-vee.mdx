I'm excited to share that starting today, I am now a Software Engineer II at Hy-Vee working out of their [Technology Center](https://www.dimin.com/projects/hy-vee-inc-technology-center/) in Grimes, IA. It's been a great 3 years at Workiva and I'm proud of the work I've accomplished.

I'll be working on [Aisles Online](https://www.hy-vee.com/grocery/) - the easiest way to shop for groceries online with delivery to your doorstep.

### Their Campus

I'm thrilled to work out of their Technology Center, which has some amazing amenities.

There's even a pickup location for Aisles Online so that I can grab my groceries and head home. Neat!
