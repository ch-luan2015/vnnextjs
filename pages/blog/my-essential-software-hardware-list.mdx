I've found value in learning about what tools others use to complete their personal and professional tasks. More specifically, reading about what other programmers use has led me to discover some new products and ultimately changed my daily workflow. I figured I would compile a list of my own personal necessities. Most are tailored to my professions (programming and videography).

**Note:** These are _my_ essential tools. Your mileage may vary.
