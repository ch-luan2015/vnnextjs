I'm constantly inspired by innovative website designs. In my opinion, no one does a better job than [Stripe](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites). After reading their article about how they redesigned [Connect](https://stripe.com/blog/connect-front-end-experience), I was determined to learn more about creating animations using only CSS.

I've found I learn best by doing - creating tangible examples where I have to apply the skills I've studied. My mission was to learn more about CSS animations. To achieve that goal, I came up with a fun idea to make an Iowa State logo animated to swirl like a tornado.

### Creating The Logo

The Cyclone's logo in the late 80's to early 90's represented a tornado. Here's the base I started with.

I took this .png into Adobe Illustrator to create an SVG [(Scalable Vector Graphic)](https://svgontheweb.com/). SVGs look crisp at all screen resolutions, have super small file sizes, and can be easily edited and modified. I traced the path of the tornado as seen below and created the .svg file.

### Learning About Animations

CSS3 animations allow you to gradually change from one style to another. To define how those styles change at certain times, we use a `@keyframes` rule. In the example below, I've created a `keyframes` rule entitled "color" to change the `fill` selector to different colors based on the percentage complete. This will change the logo from cardinal â†’ gold â†’ cardinal.

```css
@keyframes color {
  0% {
    fill: #99002f;
  }
  50% {
    fill: #ffc426;
  }
  100% {
    fill: #99002f;
  }
}
```

We need to specify which element we want to bind this animation to. Using the `animation` property, we can apply the `color` rule and configure how it runs. Animations have six different properties:

- `animation-name`
- `animation-duration`
- `animation-timing-function`
- `animation-delay`
- `animation-iteration-count`
- `animation-direction`
- `animation-fill-mode`

For more information on the specifics of each property, check out the [full documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp). Here's how we would apply these properties to make our logo change colors.

```css
svg path {
  animation-name: color;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.85, 0.01, 0.25, 1);
}
```

You can also use the short-hand version.

```css
svg path {
  animation: color 2s infinite cubic-bezier(0.85, 0.01, 0.25, 1);
}
```

This applies the "color" `@keyframes` rule to the SVG's path which will repeat forever in 2-second increments using the [cubic-bezier](http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) timing function. We can apply this same idea to make the logo spin. First, let's create another `@keyframes` rule for spinning.

```css
@keyframes spin {
  0% {
    transform: rotateX(-20deg) rotateY(20deg);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotateX(-20deg) rotateY(740deg);
  }
}
```

Finally, let's apply this rule to our container element.

```css
.container {
  animation: spin 2s infinite cubic-bezier(0.85, 0.01, 0.25, 1);
}
```

### Final Result ðŸŽ‰
